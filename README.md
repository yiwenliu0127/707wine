# Final Project for BIOS707

## Dataset: Wine Reviews

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews#winemag-data-130k-v2.csv

The data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of November 22nd, 2017. 


In this project, Benji, Yiwen, and Wendi attempted to develop a prediction model 
that can predict the price and points of each wine. After comparing multiple 
methods using Cross-Validation, we decided a Support Vector Machine had the best
performance.

Challenges Faced:
Large quantities of missing data
Few continuous variables
Categorical variables with many levels
Extracting the correct vintage from wine label
Too many observations for computationally intense methods
